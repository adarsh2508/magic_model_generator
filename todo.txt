* Make it work for rails 2.0, 2.2, 2.3
* Migrate to latest newgem
* Migrate to use rubigen structure for generators (rails_generators/)

* Discover primary keys/composite primary keys and set_primary_key[s] if not equal to default id col name for that table.
* Plugins/env.rb snippets can hook into generator process to embed additional code (e.g. for hobo_models)
