= magic_model_generator

NOTE: this is an old project that is undergoing restoration for Rails 2.3+ I will make public announcements on http://rubyflow.com when its back alive and working.

* http://magicmodels.rubyforge.org/magic_model_generator

== DESCRIPTION:

Generates Rails models from the target database... magically! Validations and associations included.

Imagine you get offered $5,000 to write a basic website/admin application on a legacy database that has 200 interconnected tables. Youâ€™ll need to add all the associations and validations based on the existing schema.

Imagine how long that would take! 1 day? 1 week? more?

Try 1 minute.

The Magic Model Generator does all this for you automatically.
