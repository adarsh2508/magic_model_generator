h1. Magic Model Generator

h1. ./script/generate magic_model


h2. What

Imagine you get offered $5,000 to write a basic website/admin application on a legacy database that has 200 interconnected tables. You'll need to add all the associations and validations based on the existing schema. 

Imagine how long that would take! 1 day? 1 week? more?

Try 1 minute.

The Magic Model Generator does all this for you automatically.

h2. Installing

<pre syntax="ruby">$ sudo gem install magic_model_generator</pre>

h2. Quick demo

Create a rails application, and point it to your database.

<pre>$ rails magic_show -d [mysql|sqlite|postgresql|oracle|etc|etc]
$ cd magic_show
$ cp database.yml.sample database.yml
and point it to your database.yml to your legacy database
</pre>

In the video below I use the database created for the ActiveRecord test cases &#8211; <code>activerecord_unittest</code>. If you&#8217;ve never downloaded the activerecord gem, run:

<pre>$ rake build_[mysql|sqlite|postgresql|oracle|etc|etc]_databases
$ rake test_[mysql|sqlite|postgresql|oracle|etc|etc]</pre>

Now install the magic_model_generator gem:

<pre>$ sudo gem install magic_model_generator</pre>

By the way, that&#8217;s all the preparation I did for the video.

Now recreate the <code>schema.rb</code> file and the <code>schema_info</code> database table via 

<pre>$ rake db:migrate</pre>.

Finally, run the generator:

<pre>$ ./script/generate magic_model</pre>

h3. Coming

Currently rails_generators cannot merge results into existing files, only skip or overwrite. I am investigating a fix for this so that you can use the MMG for iterative development.
